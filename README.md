# LOK-Scanner

## Overview
**LOK-Scanner** was a WebSocket scraper/hack tool designed to scan unencrypted WebSockets in League of Kingdoms (LoK). This tool exploited vulnerabilities in LoK's WebSocket implementation, providing a significant advantage to users.

## Disclaimer
The developers at LoK did not implement robust security measures, allowing for this exploitation. I no longer play League of Kingdoms and no longer support or maintain this project.

## Features
- Scan and intercept unencrypted WebSocket communications.
- Gain insights and data from in-game WebSocket traffic.
